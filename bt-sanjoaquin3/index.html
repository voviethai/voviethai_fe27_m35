            <p class="sec1-p1">
                It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when
                looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution
                of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many
                desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a
                search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have
                evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

                "There is no one who loves pain itself, who seeks after it and wants to have it, simply because it is

                    What's 75 million years old and brand spanking new? A teenage Utahceratops! Come to the Saroyan, armed
                    with your best dinosaur roar, when Scott Sampson, Research Curator at the Utah Museum of Natural
                    History, steps to the podium. Sampson's research has focused on the ecology and evolution of late
                    Cretaceous dinosaurs and he has conducted fieldwork in a number of countries in Africa. <br> <br>
    
                    Scott Sampson is a Canadian-born paleontologist who received his Ph.D. in zoology from the University of
                    Toronto. His doctoral work focused on two new species of ceratopsids (horned dinosaurs) from the Late
                    Cretaceous of Montana, as well as the growth and function of certopsid horns and frills.

                Following graduation in 1993, Sampson spent a year working at the American Museum of Natural History in
                New York City, followed by five years as assistant professor of anatomy at the New York College of
                Osteopathic Medicine on Long Island. He arrived at the University of Utah accepting a dual position as
                assistant professor in the Department of Geology and Geophysics and curator of vertebrate paleontology
                at the Utah Museum of Natural History. His research interests largely revolve around the phylogenetics,
                functional morphology, and evolution of Late Cretaceous dinosaurs. <br> <br>

                In addition to his museum and laboratory-based studies, Sampson has conducted paleontological work in
                Zimbabwe, South Africa, and Madagascar, as well as the United States and Canada. He was also the on-air
                host for the Discovery Channel's Dinosaur Planet and recently completed a book, Dinosaur Odyssey: Fossil
                Threads in the Web of Life, which is one of the most comprehensive surveys of dinosaurs and their worlds
                to date.
